# Water_Potability_Prediction
 The objective of this machine learning problem is to predict whether a given set of water quality parameters meets the potability criteria or not based on the provided features.
pH -
Represents the pH level of the water. Unit: pH (dimensionless)

Hardness -
Indicates the concentration of minerals, primarily calcium and magnesium, in the water. Unit: mg/L (milligrams per liter)

Solids -
Refers to the total dissolved solids in the water, which includes minerals, salts, and organic matter. Unit: ppm (parts per million)

Chloramines -
Represents the concentration of chloramines, which are disinfection byproducts formed when chlorine is used for water treatment. Unit: ppm (parts per million)

Sulfate -
Indicates the concentration of sulfate ions in the water. Unit: mg/L (milligrams per liter)

Conductivity -
Reflects the water's ability to conduct an electrical current, which is influenced by dissolved ions. Unit: µS/cm (micro Siemens per centimeter)

Organic carbon -
Indicates the concentration of organic carbon compounds in the water. Unit: ppm (parts per million)

Trihalomethanes -
Represents the concentration of trihalomethanes, which are disinfection byproducts formed during water treatment. Unit: µg/L (micrograms per liter)

Turbidity -
Refers to the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles. Unit: NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)

Potability (Target Variable) -
Indicates whether the water is considered safe for drinking or not. Values: 0 (Not Potable), 1 (Potable)
